## Grafana 
Grafana doesn’t require you to ingest data to a backend store or vendor database. Instead, Grafana takes a unique approach to providing a “single-pane-of-glass” by unifying your existing data, wherever it lives.

## Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-docker/issues), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.
